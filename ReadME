Explanation of the important files
* The 3 pictures: are used to deliver instructions to the participant, should be downloaded
* The RPEP_functions.py file: is used to store the functions that can be used both in the file for the staircase as in the file for the actual experiment
   - this to reduce the double work as staircase & experiment have many overlapping functions 
   - the stimuli however are copied into the 2 files 
* The RPEP_Staircase_2down_1up.py file: a staircase in which the opacity of the target is adapted 
   - goal: set opacity so that participant will detect target with 70% accuracy 
   - 2down 1up: after 2 correct answers the opacity decreases (harder), after every incorrect answer the opacity increases (easier) 
     --> will converge to an accuracy of ca. 70% eventually 
   - then based on the demo 'JND_staircase_analysis' of Psychopy, the 70% treshold is defined
     --> this treshold is then stored in a numpy output file, which will be used again when running the actual experiment as value for the target opacity 
* The RPEP_experiment.py file: the actual experiment 
   - try-out option: when put to 0 the target_opacity is defined by the numpy output file from the staircase; when put to 1 the target_opacity is equal to the try_out_opa
   - speedy-option: when put to 1 the whole experiment is ran, an automatic response is given right after appearance of the flash & the target 
     --> can be handy to check whether the refresh rate of your computer is actually 60Hz as expected in this code 
   

How to run the experiment
1. Download all files mentioned below into the same folder
   - RPEP_functions.py
   - RPEP_Staircase_2down_1up.py
   - RPRP_experiment.py
   - Instructies_exp1.png
   - Instructies_exp2.png
   - Instructies_exp3.png
2. Change some variables in the files
   - ppd: depends on the settings of your monitor (is used for the fixation cross)
     --> pixels per degree 
   - used_monitor: change this to match your monitor 
3. How to run the experiment (part 1: staircase; part 2: actual experiment)
   - first run the staircase (RPEP_Staircase_2down_1up)
     --> the correct value for the opacity (to achieve 70% correct) will be stored in a numpy file in the output_staircase folder
   - then run the actual experiment
     --> when try_out == 0: then it will get the opacity from the staircase via filling in the same participant number in the dialogue box
